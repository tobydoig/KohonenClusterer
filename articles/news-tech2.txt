This week, Mexican Senator Omar Fayad from ruling party PRI proposed a law to the Mexican Senate that would make it illegal to update your OS, disparage politicians, or become a whistleblower (Google translation of Spanish original), among other such nonsense. The poorly drafted law was written with the collaboration of the Mexican Federal Police — the agency that caused the U.S. government to cut back its financial support in the Mexican drug war because of their constant human rights abuses. Unsurprisingly, the stated goals of the law are to fight child pornography, identity theft, online bullying, and financial fraud.
