Having lost an estimated $1.7 billion in his Valeant 'investment' Bill Ackman's almost-four-hour press conference this morning has done nothing to save the stock after yesterday's endless-whammies.  Having bounced up near $110 at the start of the call, VRX is now trading back near the after-hours lows last night, back under $100, after Citron Research warned Valeant is "dirtier than anyone has reported."
